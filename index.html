    <h1>Hello, English 388!</h1>
    <p>My name is Autumn Marquez an I am a 22-year-old, full-time college student at the University of Washington located in Seattle, Washington. 
        I am working towards obtaining my bachelor's degree in English. 
        I have grown up as a small-town girl my whole life.
         Where my dreams to move to a big city have blossomed in hopes to find a new adventure, along with my cat Cece. 
         I have worked various jobs as a barista, a server/hostess, a wine attendant, and more recently, at a local cafe in Capitol Hill as a line and pastry cook. 
         I also have a small photography business where you can find my works on Instagram using the tag @photosbyautumnrose.
          I like trying new things, whether it be food, languages, movies, traveling, photography, or writing. 
          I am always ready for the crazy adventure that awaits. </p>
